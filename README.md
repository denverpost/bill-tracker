# Bill Tracker
Let's publish Colorado State bills.

## How to manage the site

### At the start of a legislative session
1. Turn on the cron jobs.
2. Update the README to reference the year of the current session.
3. Update the lines in the repo marked with `***HC` to reference or include the current session.

### At the end of a legislative session
1. Turn off the cron jobs.

## How to use this code
legquery.py expects an environment variable named `SUNLIGHT_API_KEY` set with your sunlight foundation API key in it. You can get a key at http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/

About the Sunlight API: https://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/bills.html

### Setting up a dev environment
Here's the third draft of instructions:

1. Check out / update the repo.
2. Create a virtual environtment, activate it.
3. Download the project requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download all the bills: `python legquery.py --verbose`
5. Download the bill details for the current session: `python legquery.py --session 2016a --details`
6. Open a new terminal window, cd to the project, activate the virtualenv
7. `python runserver.py`, then open up http://localhost:5000/
8. To get previous legislative sessions to work, you'll need the bill details for the prior sessions. `for s in "2015a" "2014a" "2013a" "2012b" "2012a" "2011a"; do python legquery.py --session $s --details --verbose; done` should do that for you.

#### Deploying

Note: `--freeze` takes a snapshot of the current templates. If you haven't made any template- or data-level changes since the last time you froze, you don't need to `--freeze`.

* Deploy everything: `python deploy.py --freeze --ftp`
* Deploy the homepage `python deploy.py --nosession --freeze --ftp`
* Deploy the current session's files `python deploy.py --session 2016a --freeze --ftp`
* Deploy a previous session's files `python deploy.py --session 2012a --freeze --ftp`
